        <h1>Sovanny Seng ðŸ’–</h1>
        <p>My name is Sovanny Seng and I am an aspiring software developer. Currently, I am enrolled in a technical and career development program at <strong><a href="https://www.yearup.org/">Year Up</a></strong> The languages I am learning are HTML,
          CSS, and Javascript.

          Prior to the program, I worked as a periodontal assistant providing 5-star customer service chairside. The sudden career change is partly due to a newfound interest in the field and realizing the lack of representation of South East Asians
          in the tech industry, specifically Cambodians. I want to help change the narrative for the younger generation and show that they can pursue any career.</p>

          <p>Aside from programming and being a student, some hobbies of mine include: Traveling, playing pickleball and being a foodie!</p>
